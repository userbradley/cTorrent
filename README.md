## what is cTorrent?

Simply put this is a terraform and ansible and what ever else follows script that allows you to torrent using cloud servers opposed to your home connection as I am on my last warning with my ISP for torrenting at home.

This will <sup>hopefully</sup> hopefully do a few things:

1. Ask you for your SSH key file or location
2. Ask what cloud provider you're using
3. Ask for access creds for a wasabi s3 bucket
4. Ask for the bucket name
5. Ask for the magnet URL of the file
6. Create a small VPS
7. Start the torrent and copy it to the bucket after it's done
8. Destry the vps

# Will it work?

Probably not - Guess stay tuned. This is an internal tool that I have released for "Public release"
